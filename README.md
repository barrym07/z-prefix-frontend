This is a full stack PERN CRUD application.

## How do I use it?

Users who are not signed can view all posts on the website. If you click the title, works in bold you be brought to that individual post's view. If you click on the author, you will be brought to all of that author's posts.

You can register by clicking Sign Up, once you have completed the sign up process you be redirected to the login page. If this is the first time logging in you will see all posts, if you have made blog posts here before you will be taking to your own posts.

A logged in user has full management over their posts, they can edit and delete at will. To do so click the title of a post that you published. You will have two options Delete and Edit. Delete will remove the post and edit will allow you make changes to the title and content of the post.
